# How To Play the Game
When the game starts the first screen you will see is the rules of the game.You will have 30 secs to read them before the game moves on to the next screen. <br>

The next screen will give you the option to select easy or hard. <br>

To select easy mode press the e key, to select hard mode press the h key
  - The snake (brown) in brown will start going towards the left automatically
  - The prey (green) will also appear in a random spot
  - Use the WASD keys to change directions for the snake
    - W - moves the snake up
    - A - moves the snake left
    - S - moves the snake down
    - D - moves the snake right <br>


You must control the snake to get it to consume the prey (green) and when it does the snake will increase in size by 1 everytime.
If you let the snake hit the window boundaries or you end up running the snake into itself, it will be game over and the window will close.
